 still a WIP I need to figure out some logic... or I could brute force it 
 the program will ask for the amount of bananas available, the base price of a monkey, and for the price of each upgrade path. 
 it will then give you a distribution that will use as much of that money as possible. 
 this can be used to farm tower exp on deflation maps.
